# node-red-contrib-philips-airjs
NodeRed node for Philips Air purifier in js.

# What is this ?

This is a node for Node-Red to view the status of a Philips Air purifier and send command to a Philips Air purifier
It makes use of the COAP protocol and is based on project by @biemond (https://github.com/biemond/com.athom.philipsair.git )
and @betaboon ( https://github.com/betaboon/aioairctrl.git ).

Current support in NodeRed is doen via nodes that bridge 'aioairctrl' and this are not native JS implementations, they use Python.

# Status

Proof of concept is working.
